# IRISPy LMSAL fork

IRISPy is a [SunPy](http://sunpy.org)-affiliated package that provides the tools to read in and
analyze data from the [IRIS](http://iris.lmsal.com) solar-observing satellite in Python.

The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph is a NASA-funded Small Explorer which uses a
high-frame-rate ultraviolet imaging spectrometer to make observations of the Sun. It provides
0.3 arcsec angular resolution and sub-angstrom spectral resolution at a one second cadence.

For more information see the mission/instrument paper which is available [online for free](https://www.lmsal.com/iris_science/doc?cmd=dcur&proj_num=IS0196&file_type=pdf).

This IRISPy LMSAL fork is meant to allow (for now only LMSAL) scientist to contribute
as a team in this fork. This code will be maintain, supervised and cleaned so eventually
reaches the [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) standards and eventually merge them.

# Why community fork

It takes time for scientist to reach or dedicate the necessary time on cleaning, add the
right structure or documentation. However, they could provide with large amount of code. We
do not want to stop this flow. By contributing a small community into this fork and having
the expertise to revise it, will accelerate the contribution to Sunpy. Each group could
supervise or chose which could be the minimal standards, threshold in the python phylosophy
etc. Some groups may have the help from expertise others may be that the collaborators
take care of the code until it reaches the minimum standards in order to get merged into github.

# At LMSAL:

We will have the help form ??? to supervise the code that we develop. In principle, we do not include
any restrictions on the code added here (at least at the beginning). Or perhaps we could add 
some sort of scripts that makes sure that a minimal thing works ... we don't want to have
a crash by doing only import irispy right? Similar things we have for Bifrost.
